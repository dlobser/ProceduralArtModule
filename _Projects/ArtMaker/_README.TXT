WHAT IS IT:

The 'ArtMaker' system is a combination of a prefab
and a class designed for inheritance.
The system will reduce the amount of labor it takes
to create layouts of your procedural artworks.

HOW TO MAKE:

Drag the ArtMaker prefab into your scene

Make a script or duplicate 'ArtSquareSimple'
    and attach it to an empty gameObject

Your script should use the 'Art' namespace

and inherit from 'ArtMakerTemplate' 
    or 'ArtMaker'(if you want more control)

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:

the keyboard shortcut 'r' will rebuild your ArtMaker

'g' will generate your grid

'd' will delete your grid

click on a square to rebuild just that square

'shift+s' will save a screenshot
    (to a folder one above 'Assets')
